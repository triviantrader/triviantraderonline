            disable some of these features, you may disable cookies in your web browser’s settings. Web beacon and other
            technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate are disregarded and

            email or any other medium. We may also store and publish such information to assist us in making the
            Platform better and easier to use.
            Additionally, we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to
            technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered

            Mobile platforms (Android and iOS) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without
            your consent. These platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. Upon becoming
            operational, the iOS platform will alert you the first time our App wants permission to access certain types
            of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the
            permissions that our App seeks before you first use the App, and your use of the App constitutes your
            consent. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the
            permissions we request will change over time.
            Android permissions:
            Device & App history: We need your device permission to get information about your device, like OS name, OS
            version, mobile network, hardware model, preferred language, installed apps etc. Based on these inputs, we
            intend to optimize your overall experience by understanding your preferences and by using OS specific
            capabilities.
            Identity: This permission enables us to know about details of your account(s) on your mobile device. We may
            use this info to auto-fill your email address and provide a typing free in-channel experience. It also
            allows facilitating your login.
            Contacts: If you allow us to access your contacts, it enables us to make it easy to get referred by your
            friends and also send across referral links to your friends. This information will be stored on our servers
            and synced from your phone.
            Location: If you allow us access to your location, we will be in a position to provide you a personalized
            experience based on your location.
            Wi-Fi: When you allow us the permission to detect your Wi-Fi connection, we optimize your experience based
            on the connection speed.
            Device ID & call information: This permission is used to detect your Android ID through which we can
            uniquely identify users.
